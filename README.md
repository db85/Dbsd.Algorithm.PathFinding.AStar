# Dbsd.Algorithm.PathFinding.AStar
An implementation of the AStar (A*) search algorithm in .net8.0 (c#). The implementation allows to create the nodes dynamically during the execution. A fixed list of nodes from the beginning is not necessary.

The implementation is kept very abstract so that it can be used flexibly in the repository.
